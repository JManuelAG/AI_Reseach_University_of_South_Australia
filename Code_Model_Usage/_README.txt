The following folder contains two examples of how to interact with the models. 

HF_pipeline
This method requires you to download the model and use the transformers library, this is really easy and straightforward. I have included an example usage of the following task:
•	Summarization
•	QA
•	Text Generation

InferenceClient
This program uses the InferenceClient library to interact with the models I have only included a text generation task as an example but is really straightforward to understand other uses. This method doesn’t require to download model
