This folder contains three different programs that use fine tuned models for an specific task

Bert_Models_Summary
This program uses the BERT and CLinicalBERT models for a summarization doing a cosine similarity to choose the most relevant sentences, I created this method for summarising and to compare results from a medical train model.

ClinicalBert_ICD10
This program uses ClinicalBERT for identifying the ICD10 codes on a corpus of text (ideally symptoms)

ClinicalBert_NER
This program demonstrates how the ClinicalBERT identifies the medical terms on a corpus, it can be use to prove accuracy 

FineTunned_Model_Usage
Sample usage of PEFT Fine tuned models, wich I personally fine tunned or for any future Fine tunning
