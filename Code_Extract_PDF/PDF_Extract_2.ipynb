      "A Digital Twin Approach for Contextual Assistance for Surgeons During Surgical Robotics Training\n",
      "Minimally invasive robotic surgery copes with some disadvantages for the surgeon of minimally invasive surgery while preserving the advantages for the patient. Most commercially available robotic systems are telemanipulated with haptic input devices. The exploitation of the haptics channel, e.g., by means of Virtual Fixtures, would allow for an individualized enhancement of surgical performance with contextual assistance. However, it remains an open field of research as it is non-trivial to estimate the task context itself during a surgery. In contrast, surgical training allows to abstract away from a real operation and thus makes it possible to model the task accurately. The presented approach exploits this fact to parameterize Virtual Fixtures during surgical training, proposing a Shared Control Parametrization Engine that retrieves procedural context information from a Digital Twin. This approach accelerates a proficient use of the robotic system for novice surgeons by augmenting the surgeon's performance through haptic assistance. With this our aim is to reduce the required skill level and cognitive load of a surgeon performing minimally invasive robotic surgery. A pilot study is performed on the DLR MiroSurge system to evaluate the presented approach. The participants are tasked with two benchmark scenarios of surgical training. The execution of the benchmark scenarios requires basic skills as pick, place and path following. The evaluation of the pilot study shows the promising trend that novel users profit from the haptic augmentation during training of certain tasks.\n",

      "A Digital Twin Platform for Diagnostics and Rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis\n",
      "30 million people across Europe are affected approximately from rare diseases. The brain disorders (including, but not limited to those affecting mental health) remain a major challenge. The understanding of mental disorders' determinants and causes, processes and impacts is a key to their prevention, early detection and treatment as well as factor for good health and well-being. In order to improve the health and disease understanding, a close linkage between fundamental, clinical, epidemiological and socio-economic research is required. Effective sharing of data, standardized data processing and the linkage of such data with large-scale cohort studies is a prerequisite for translation of research findings into the clinic. In this context, this paper proposes a platform for exploration of behavioral changes in patients with proven cognitive disorders with a focus on Multiple Sclerosis. It adopts the concept of a digital twin by applying the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to allow for deep analysis of medical data to estimate human health status, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients. The platform has two main components. The first component, provides functionality for diagnostics and rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis and acts as a main provider of data for the second component. The second component is an advanced analytical application, which provides services for data aggregation, enrichment, analysis and visualization that will be used to produce a new knowledge and support decision in each instance of the transactional component.\n",

      "A Framework for the generation of digital twins of cardiac electrophysiology from clinical 12-leads ECGs\n",
      "a b s t r a c t Cardiac digital twins (Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT)s) of human electrophysiology (Electrophysiology (EP)) are digital replicas of patient hearts derived from clinical data that match like-for-like all available clinical observations. Due to their inherent predictive potential, CDTs show high promise as a complementary modality aiding in clinical decision making and also in the cost-effective, safe and ethical testing of novel EP device therapies. However, current workflows for both the anatomical and functional twinning phases within CDT generation, referring to the inference of model anatomy and parameters from clinical data, are not sufficiently efficient, robust and accurate for advanced clinical and industrial applications. Our study addresses three primary limitations impeding the routine generation of high-fidelity CDTs by introducing; a comprehensive parameter vector encapsulating all factors relating to the ventricular EP; an abstract reference frame within the model allowing the unattended manipulation of model parameter fields; a novel fast-forward electrocardiogram (Electrocardiogram (ECG)) model for efficient and biophysically-detailed simulation required for parameter inference. A novel workflow for the generation of CDTs is then introduced as an initial proof of concept. Anatomical twinning was performed within a reasonable time compatible with clinical workflows (<4h) for 12 subjects from clinically-attained magnetic resonance images. After assessment of the underlying fast forward ECG model against a gold standard bidomain ECG model, functional twinning of optimal parameters according to a clinically-attained 12 lead ECG was then performed using a forward Saltelli sampling approach for a single subject. The achieved results in terms of efficiency and fidelity demonstrate that our workflow is well-suited and viable for generating biophysically-detailed CDTs at scale.\n",

Taking into account new challenges related to the optimization of the patient care pathway in the emergency unit in the context of major crises, we propose a flexible tool that can be used by health-care practitioners as a decision aid in various situations under the shape of a digital twin of the emergency unit. The modelling framework is based a modular model with specific representation of care pathways and resources activities. Various arrival processes are modelled in order to comply with the periodic variations observed in data history as well as exceptional massive arrivals that may be related to major crisis.

      "Edited by Charles L. Sawyers, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, and approved April 7, 2021 (received for review November 25, 2020) This paper presents a modular software design for the construction of computational modeling technology that will help implement precision medicine. In analogy to a common industrial strategy used for preventive maintenance of engineered products, medical digital twins are computational models of disease processes calibrated to individual patients using multiple heterogeneous data streams. They have the potential to help improve diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment for a wide range of medical conditions. Their large-scale development relies on both mechanistic and datadriven techniques and requires the integration and ongoing update of multiple component models developed across many different laboratories. Distributed model building and integration requires an open-source modular software platform for the integration and simulation of models that is scalable and supports a decentralized, community-based model building process. This paper presents such a platform, including a case study in an animal model of a respiratory fungal infection.\n",

This is seen as the main cause of the high morbidity and mortality rates in this group. A liquid-filled incubator, a so-called PLS system, could potentially improve these numbers for extremely premature infants, since this system is designed to mimic the environment of the natural womb. To support the development and implementation of such a complex system and to interpret vital signals of the fetus during a PLS system operation, a digital twin is proposed. This mathematical model is connected with a manikin representing the digital and physical twin of the real-life PLS system. Before developing a digital twin of a fetus in a PLS system, its functional and technical requirements are defined and existing mathematical models are evaluated. Method and results: This review summarizes existing 0D and 1D fetal circulatory models that potentially could be (partly) adopted for integration in a digital twin of a fetus in a PLS system based on predefined requirements. The 0D models typically describe hemodynamics and/or oxygen transport during specific events, such as the transition from fetus to neonate. Furthermore, these models can be used to find hemodynamic di erences between healthy and pathological physiological states. Rather than giving a global description of an entire cardiovascular system, some studies focus on specific organs or vessels. In order to analyze pressure and flow wave profiles in the cardiovascular system, transmission line or 1D models are used. As for now, these models do not include oxygen transport. Conclusion: This study shows that none of the models identified in literature meet all the requirements relevant for a digital twin of a fetus in a PLS system. Nevertheless, it does show the potential to develop this digital twin by integrating (parts) of models into a single model.\n",

      "A semi-active human digital twin model for detecting severity of carotid stenoses from head vibration-A coupled computational mechanics and computer vision method\n",
      "In this work, we propose a methodology to detect the severity of carotid stenosis from a video of a human face with the help of a coupled blood flow and head vibration model. This semi-active digital twin model is an attempt to link noninvasive video of a patient face to the percentage of carotid occlusion. The pulsatile nature of blood flow through the carotid arteries induces a subtle head vibration. This vibration is a potential indicator of carotid stenosis severity, and it is exploited in the present study. A head vibration model has been proposed in the present work that is linked to the forces generated by blood flow with or without occlusion. The model is used to generate a large number of virtual head vibration data for different degrees of occlusion. In order to determine the in vivo head vibration, a computer vision algorithm is adopted to use human face videos. The in vivo vibrations are compared against the virtual vibration data generated from the coupled computational blood flow/vibration model. A comparison of the in vivo vibration is made against the virtual data to find the best fit between in vivo and virtual data. The preliminary results on healthy subjects and a patient clearly indicate that the model is accurate and it possesses the potential for detecting approximate severity of carotid artery stenoses.\n",

      "An AI based digital-twin for prioritising pneumonia patient treatment\n",
      "A digital-twin based three-tiered system is proposed to prioritise patients for urgent intensive care and ventilator support. The deep learning methods are used to build patient-specific digital-twins to identify and prioritise critical cases amongst severe pneumonia patients. The three-tiered strategy is proposed to generate severity indices to: (1) identify urgent cases, (2) assign critical care and mechanical ventilation, and (3) discontinue mechanical ventilation and critical care at the optimal time. The severity indices calculated in the present study are the probability of death and the probability of requiring mechanical ventilation. These enable the generation of patient prioritisation lists and facilitates the smooth flow of patients in and out of Intensive Therapy Units (ITUs). The proposed digital-twin is built on pre-trained deep learning models using data from more than 1895 pneumonia patients. The severity indices calculated in the present study are assessed using the standard benchmark of Area Under Receiving Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). The results indicate that the ITU and mechanical ventilation can be prioritised correctly to an AUROC value as high as 0.89. This model may be employed in its current form to COVID-19 patients, but transfer learning with COVID-19 patient data will improve the predictions. The digital-twin model developed and tested is available via accompanying Supplemental material.\n",

      "An Attention-Based ResNet Architecture for Acute Hemorrhage Detection and Classification: Toward a Health 4.0 Digital Twin Study\n",
      "Due to the advancement of digital twin (DT) technology, Health 4.0 applications have become reality and starting to take roots. In this article, we focus on intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) which is a lifethreatening emergency that needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. ICH is caused by bleeding inside the skull or brain. Radiologists typically examine computed tomography (CT) scans of the patients to determine the ICH and its subtype. But the manual assessment of the CT scan is a complex and time-consuming task. The existing pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models are state-of-the-art for ICH classi cation. However, they employ poor feature extraction techniques which hinder overall model performance. Furthermore, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality and use redundant and noisy features. The problem of imbalanced data is also crucial for achieving model generalization. This paper proposes a hybrid attentionbased ResNet architecture for ICH detection and classi cation. An attention mechanism allows the model to focus on a speci c region and extract relevant features. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and redundant feature removal whereas deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) is used for resolving the class imbalance problem. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset assembled during the Radiologist Society of North America (RSNA) ICH detection challenge 2019. The results show that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and F1-score. ICH classi cation achieved accuracies of 99.2%, 97.1%, 96.7%, 96.7% and 96.1%, for detecting epidural hemorrhage (EH), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), subdural hemorrhage (SH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) subtypes respectively. The F1-score of 96.1% for EH subtype is also best when compared with the benchmark models.\n",

      "Assessing overdiagnosis of fecal immunological test screening for colorectal cancer with a digital twin approach\n",
      "ARTICLE Evaluating the magnitude of overdiagnosis associated with stool-based service screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) beyond a randomized controlled trial is often intractable and understudied. We aim to estimate the proportion of overdiagnosis in population-based service screening programs for CRC with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The natural process of overdiagnosis-embedded disease was first built up to learn transition parameters that quantify the pathway of non-progressive and progressive screen-detected cases calibrated with sensitivity, while also taking competing mortality into account. The Markov algorithms were then developed for estimating these transition parameters based on Taiwan FIT service CRC screening data on 5,417,699 residents aged 50-69 years from 2004 to 2014. Following the digital twin design with the parallel universe structure for emulating the randomized controlled trial, the screened twin, mirroring the control group without screening, was virtually recreated by the application of the above-mentioned trained parameters to predict CRC cases containing overdiagnosis. The ratio of the predicted CRCs derived from the screened twin to the observed CRCs of the control group minus 1 was imputed to measure the extent of overdiagnosis. The extent of overdiagnosis for invasive CRCs resulting from FIT screening is 4.16% (95% CI: 2.61-5.78%). The corresponding figure is increased to 9.90% (95% CI: 8.41-11.42%) for including high grade dysplasia (HGD) and further inflated to 15.83% (95% CI: 15.23-16.46%) when the removal adenoma is considered. The modest proportion of overdiagnosis modelled by the digital twin method, dispensing with the randomized controlled trial design, suggests the harm done to population-based FIT service screening is negligible.\n",

      "Biomaterialomics: Data science-driven pathways to develop fourth-generation biomaterials\n",
      "a b s t r a c t Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment. This leads to longer development cycles, and high costs. To meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices. Building on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development. The Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'. While analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions. Such integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processingstructure-property (PSP) linkages. A few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e. patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine. The increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended.\n",

      "Cardiac patientespecific three-dimensional models as surgical planning tools\n",
      "a b s t r a c t Background: Three-dimensional printing is an additive manufacturing method that builds objects from digitally generated computational models. Core technologies behind three-dimensional printing are evolving rapidly with major advances in materials, resolution, and speed that enable greater realism and higher accuracy. These improvements have led to novel applications of these processes in the medical field. Methods: The process of going from a medical image data set (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound) to a physical three-dimensional print includes several steps that are described. Medical images originate from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine files or data sets, the current standard for storing and transmitting medical images. Via Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine manipulation software packages, a segmentation process, and manual intervention by an expert user, three-dimensional digital and printed models can be constructed in great detail. Results: Cardiovascular medicine is one of the fastest growing applications for medical threedimensional printing. The technology is more frequently being used for patient and clinician education, preprocedural planning, and medical device design and prototyping. We report on three case studies, describing how our three-dimensional printing has contributed to the care of cardiac patients at the University of Minnesota. Conclusion: Medical applications of computational three-dimensional modeling and printing are already extensive and growing rapidly and are routinely used for visualizing complex anatomies from patient imaging files to plan surgeries and create surgical simulators. Studies are needed to determine whether three-dimensional printed models are cost effective and can consistently improve clinical outcomes before they become part of routine clinical practice.\n",

      "Cardiovascular models for personalised medicine: Where now and where next?\n",
      "journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/medengphy The aim of this position paper is to provide a brief overview of the current status of cardiovascular modelling and of the processes required and some of the challenges to be addressed to see wider exploitation in both personal health management and clinical practice. In most branches of engineering the concept of the digital twin, informed by extensive and continuous monitoring and coupled with robust data assimilation and simulation techniques, is gaining traction: the Gartner Group listed it as one of the top ten digital trends in 2018. The cardiovascular modelling community is starting to develop a much more systematic approach to the combination of physics, mathematics, control theory, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science and advanced engineering methodology, as well as working more closely with the clinical community to better understand and exploit physiological measurements, and indeed to develop jointly better measurement protocols informed by model-based understanding. Developments in physiological modelling, model personalisation, model outcome uncertainty, and the role of models in clinical decision support are addressed and 'where-next' steps and challenges discussed. © 2019 IPEM.

      "New technologies enable the creation of digital twin systems (DTS) combining continuous data collection from children's home and artificial intelligence (AI)-based recommendations to adapt their care in real time. The objective was to assess whether children and adolescents with asthma would be ready to use such DTS. A mixed-method study was conducted with 104 asthma patients aged 8 to 17 years. The potential advantages and disadvantages associated with AI and the use of DTS were collected in semi-structured interviews. Children were then asked whether they would agree to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma. The strength of their decision was assessed as well as the factors determining their choice. The main advantages of DTS identified by children were the possibility to be (i) supported in managing their asthma (ii) from home and (iii) in real time. Technical issues and the risk of loss of humanity were the main drawbacks reported. Half of the children (56%) were willing to use a DTS for the daily management of their asthma if it was as effective as current care, and up to 93% if it was more effective. Those with the best computer skills were more likely to choose the DTS, while those who placed a high value on the physician-patient relationship were less likely to do so.    Conclusions: The majority of children were ready to use a DTS for the management of their asthma, particularly if it was more effective than current care. The results of this study support the development of DTS for childhood asthma and the evaluation of their effectiveness in clinical trials.\n",

      "Systems-based digital twins to help characterize clinical dose-response and propose predictive biomarkers in a Phase I study of bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, in NHL\n",
      "Phase I oncology clinical trials often comprise a limited number of patients representing different disease subtypes who are divided into cohorts receiving treatment(s) at different dosing levels and schedules. Here, we leverage a previously developed quantitative systems pharmacology model of the anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, to account for different dosing regimens and patient heterogeneity in the phase I study to inform clinical dose/exposure-response relationships and to identify biological determinants of clinical response. We developed a novel workflow to generate digital twins for each patient, which together form a virtual population (VPOP) that represented variability in biological, pharmacological, and tumor-related parameters from the phase I trial. Simulations based on the VPOP predict that an increase in mosunetuzumab exposure increases the proportion of digital twins with at least a 50% reduction in tumor size by day 42. Simulations also predict a left-shift of the exposure-response in patients diagnosed with indolent compared to aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype; this increased sensitivity in indolent NHL was attributed to the lower inferred values of tumor proliferation rate and baseline T-cell infiltration in the corresponding digital twins. Notably, the inferred digital twin parameters from clinical responders and nonresponders show that the potential biological difference that can influence response include tumor parameters (tumor size, proliferation rate, and baseline T-cell infiltration) and parameters defining the effect of mosunetuzumab on T-cell activation and B-cell killing. Finally, the model simulations suggest intratumor expansion of Saroja Ramanujan and Iraj Hosseini are co-senior authors.\n",

      "Clinically-Driven Virtual Patient Cohorts Generation: An Application to Aorta\n",
      "The combination of machine learning methods together with computational modeling and simulation of the cardiovascular system brings the possibility of obtaining very valuable information about new therapies or clinical devices through in-silico experiments. However, the application of machine learning methods demands access to large cohorts of patients. As an alternative to medical data acquisition and processing, which often requires some degree of manual intervention, the generation of virtual cohorts made of synthetic patients can be automated. However, the generation of a synthetic sample can still be computationally demanding to guarantee that it is clinically meaningful and that it reflects enough inter-patient variability. This paper addresses the problem of generating virtual patient cohorts of thoracic aorta geometries that can be used for in-silico trials. In particular, we focus on the problem of generating a cohort of patients that meet a particular clinical criterion, regardless the access to a reference sample of that phenotype. We formalize the problem of clinically-driven sampling and assess several sampling strategies with two goals, sampling efficiency, i.e., that the generated individuals actually belong to the target population, and that the statistical properties of the cohort can be controlled. Our results show that generative adversarial networks can produce reliable, clinically-driven cohorts of thoracic aortas with good efficiency. Moreover, non-linear predictors can serve as an efficient alternative to the sometimes expensive evaluation of anatomical or functional parameters of the organ of interest.\n",

      "Cognitive rehabilitation in multiple sclerosis: Three digital ingredients to address current and future priorities\n",
      "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological chronic disease with autoimmune demyelinating lesions and one of the most common disability causes in young adults. People with MS (PwMS) experience cognitive impairments (CIs) and clinical evidence shows their presence during all MS stages even in the absence of other symptoms. Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) aims at reducing CI and improving PwMS' awareness of cognitive difficulties faced in their daily living. More defined cognitive profiles, easier treatment access and the need to transfer intervention effects into everyday life activities are aims of utmost relevance for CR in MS. Currently, advanced technologies may pave the way to rethink CR in MS to address the priority of more personalized and effective, accessible and ecological interventions. For this purpose, digital twins, telecognitive-rehabilitation and metaverse are the main candidate digital ingredients. Based on scientific evidences, we propose digital twin technology to enhance MS cognitive phenotyping; tele-cognitive-rehabilitation to make feasible the cognitive intervention access to a larger number of PwMS; and metaverse to represent the best choice to train real-world dual- and multi-tasking deficits in virtual daily life environments. Moreover, multi-domain high-frequency bigdata collected through tele-cognitive-assessment, tele-cognitive-rehabilitation, and metaverse may be merged to refine artificial intelligence algorithms and obtain increasingly detailed patient's cognitive profile in order to enhance intervention personalization. Here, we present how these digital ingredients and their integration could be crucial to address the current and future needs of CR facilitating the early detection of subtle CI and the delivery of increasingly effective treatments.\n",

      "A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical asset reproducing its data model, its behaviour and its communication with other physical assets. Digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. Although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. The main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technologies in healthcare. After providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.\n",

      "j o u r n a l h o m e p a g e : w w w . e l s e v i e r . c o m / l o c a t e / y m s s p A generic framework for prognostics and health monitoring (PHM) which is rapidly deployable to heterogeneous fleets of assets would allow for the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data. Deep learning based PHM implementations provide part of the solution, but their main benefits are lost when predictions still rely on historical failure data and case-by-case feature engineering. We propose a solution to these challenges in the form of a Deep Digital Twin (DDT). The DDT is constructed from deep generative models which learn the distribution of healthy data directly from operational data at the beginning of an asset's life-cycle. As the DDT learns the distribution of healthy data it does not rely on historical failure data in order to produce an estimation of asset health. This article presents an overview of the DDT framework and investigates its performance on a number of datasets. Based on these investigations, it is demonstrated that the DDT is able to detect incipient faults, track asset degradation and differentiate between failure modes in both stationary and non-stationary operating conditions when trained on only healthy operating data.\n",

      "The advances of the Internet of Things, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, to give just a few examples, allow us to imagine promising results in the development of smart buildings in the near future. In the particular case of elderly care, there are new solutions that integrate systems that monitor variables associated with the health of each user or systems that facilitate physical or cognitive rehabilitation. In all these solutions, it is clear that these new environments, usually called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), configure a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that connects information from the physical world to the cyber-world with the primary objective of adding more intelligence to these environments. This article presents a CPS-AAL for caregiving centers, with the main novelty that includes a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). The CPS-AAL presented in this work uses a digital twin world with the information acquired by all devices. The basis of this digital twin world is the CORTEX cognitive architecture, a set of software agents interacting through a Deep State Representation (DSR) that stored the shared information between them. The proposal is evaluated in a simulated environment with two use cases requiring interaction between the sensors and the SAR in a simulated caregiving center.\n",

Design: Directed acyclic graphs were used to denfie explicitly the causal relationship among organ systems and specicfi treatments used. A hybrid approach of agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, and Bayesian network was used to simulate treatment effect across multiple stages and interactions of major organ systems (cardiovascular, neurologic, renal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, inaflmmatory, and hematology). Organ systems were visualized using relevant clinical markers. The application was iteratively revised and debugged by clinical experts and engineers. Agreement statistics was used to test the performance of the model by comparing the observed patient response versus the expected response (primary and secondary) predicted by digital twin. Setting: Medical ICU of a large quaternary- care academic medical center in the United States.\n",

      "Today, there is great interest in diets proposing new combinations of macronutrient compositions and fasting schedules. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding the impact of these different diets, since available studies measure different sets of variables in different populations, thus only providing partial, non-connected insights. We lack an approach for integrating all such partial insights into a useful and interconnected big picture. Herein, we present such an integrating tool. The tool uses a novel mathematical model that describes mechanisms regulating diet response and fasting metabolic fluxes, both for organ-organ crosstalk, and inside the liver. The tool can mechanistically explain and integrate data from several clinical studies, and correctly predict new independent data, including data from a new study. Using this model, we can predict non-measured variables, e.g. hepatic glycogen and gluconeogenesis, in response to fasting and different diets. Furthermore, we exemplify how such metabolic responses can be successfully adapted to a specific individual's sex, weight, height, as well as to the individual's historical data on metabolite dynamics. This tool enables an offline digital twin technology.\n",

      "Nowadays, along with the application of newgeneration information technologies in industry and manufacturing, the big data-driven manufacturing era is coming. However, although various big data in the entire product lifecycle, including product design, manufacturing, and service, can be obtained, it can be found that the current research on product lifecycle data mainly focuses on physical products rather than virtual models. Besides, due to the lack of convergence between product physical and virtual space, the data in product lifecycle is isolated, fragmented, and stagnant, which is useless for manufacturing enterprises. These problems lead to low level of efficiency, intelligence, sustainability in product design, manufacturing, and service phases. However, physical product data, virtual product data, and connected data that tie physical and virtual product are needed to support product design, manufacturing, and service. Therefore, how to generate and use converged cyber-physical data to better serve product lifecycle, so as to drive product design, manufacturing, and service to be more efficient, smart, and sustainable, is emphasized and investigated based on our previous study on big data in product lifecycle management. In this paper, a new method for product design, manufacturing, and service driven by digital twin is proposed. The detailed application methods and frameworks of digital twin-driven product design, manufacturing, and service are investigated. Furthermore, three cases are given to illustrate the future applications of digital twin in the three phases of a product respectively.\n",

      "THE BIGGER PICTURE There is a substantial need in child protection to design the decision-making process in a way that is in the best interests of the child. The solution to this problem will not lie in new technology alone but also in new techniques and technologies that are urgently needed to make children and their interests more visible and to integrate them in decision-making processes. In the health context, this concerns particularly better knowledge of the health status of those children who are especially dependent on the vicarious decisions of others. In doing so, however, we are confronted with an ethical dilemma: on the one hand, children are a particularly vulnerable group, dependent on empowerment and opportunities for genuine participation. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) may provide a substantive opportunity to empower children by providing better and more precise information on their behalf. On the other hand, DT is a technology with great potential to add new forms of vulnerability through its constant, real-time, and ad personam predictions. Consequently, we argue that DTs hold significant potential for a positive contribution to these processes provided that critical concerns regarding vulnerability, recognition, and participation are adequately addressed.\n",

Currently, precision healthcare is seen as a challenging model to apply due to the complexity of the healthcare ecosystem, which is a multi-level and multifaceted environment with high realtime interactions among disciplines, practitioners, patients and discrete computer systems. Digital Twins (DT) pairs individual physical artefacts with digital models reflecting their status in real-time. Creating a live-model for healthcare services introduces new opportunities for patient care including better risk assessment and evaluation without disturbing daily activities. In this article, to address design and management in this complexity, we examine recent work in Digital Twins (DT) to investigate the goals of precision healthcare at a patient and healthcare system levels. We further discuss the role of DT to achieve precision healthcare, proposed frameworks, the value of active participation and continuous monitoring, and the cyber-security challenges and ethical implications for this emerging paradigm.\n",

      "Purpose Axial alignment of the talar implant in total ankle arthroplasty remains a major issue, since the real axis of motion of each patient is impossible to determine with usual techniques. Further knowledge regarding individual axis of motion of the ankle is therefore needed. Material and methods Therefore, digital twins, articfiial intelligence, and machine learning technology were used to identify a real personalized motion axis of the tibiotalar joint. Three-dimensional (3D) models of distal extremities were generated using computed tomography data of normal patients. Digital twins were used to reproduce the mobility of the ankles, and the real ankle of the patients was matched to the digital twin with machine learning technology. Results The results showed that a personalized axis can be obtained for each patient. When the origin of the axis is the centre of mass of the talus, this axis can be represented in a geodesic system. The mean value of the axis is a line passing in first approximation through the centre of the sphere (with a variation of 3 mm from the centre of the mass of the talus) and through a point with the coordinates 91.6° west and 7.4° north (range 84° to 98° west; − 2° to 12° north). This study improves the understanding of the axis of the ankle, as well as its relationship to the possibility to use the geodesic system for robotic in ankle arthroplasty. Conclusion The consideration of a personalized axis of the ankle might be helpful for better understanding of ankle surgery and particularly total ankle arthroplasty.\n",

The Digital Twin (DT) technology, based on the virtualization of physical assets/processes and on a bidirectional communication between the digital and physical space for data exchange, is considered a game changer in modern health systems. Digital Twin applications in healthcare are various, ranging from virtualization of hospitals' physical spaces/organizational processes to individuals' physiological/genetic/lifestyle characteristics replication, and include the modeling of public health-related processes for monitoring, optimization and planning purposes. In this paper, motivated by the current COVID-19 pandemic, we focus on the application of the Digital Twin technology for virus containment on the workplace through social distancing. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: i) we review the existing literature on the adoption of the Digital Twin technology in the healthcare domain, and propose a classification of DT applications into four categories; ii) we propose a generalized Digital Twin architecture that can be used as reference to identify the main functional components of a Digital Twin system; iii) we present CanTwin, a real-life industrial case study developed by Hitachi and representing the Digital Twin of a canteen service serving 1100 workers, set up for social distancing monitoring, queue inspection, people counting and tracking, table occupancy supervision.\n",

In the context of digital gait analysis and rehabilitation, different technologies have been proposed allowing objective gait assessment and precise quantification of the rehabilitation progress using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) platforms. However, this depends largely on the estimation accuracy of the kinematics (body joint angles). This paper presents the concept of a digital equivalent based on the Memory Polynomial Model (MPM) to reduce the number of IMUs needed for the measurements and to simulate the physical mechanism of lower body joint angles based on acceleration data. The MPM parameter estimation is based on the Least Square (LS) approach and is performed using accelerometer records of non-pathological gait patterns. The Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. According to the results an NMSE of -20 dB is achieved, which indicates the great potential of applying the MPM to develop a digital twin. That kind of twin can serve as a prototype of the physical counterpart to improve the wearability of the sensor system and to reduce physically induced measurement errors as well.

      "Ethical Issues of Digital Twins for Personalized Health Care Service: Preliminary Mapping Study\n",
      "Background: The concept of digital twins has great potential for transforming the existing health care system by making it more personalized. As a convergence of health care, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technologies, personalized health care services that are developed under the concept of digital twins raise a myriad of ethical issues. Although some of the ethical issues are known to researchers working on digital health and personalized medicine, currently, there is no comprehensive review that maps the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. Objective: This study aims to fill the research gap by identifying the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. We first propose a working definition for digital twins for personalized health care services to facilitate future discussions on the ethical issues related to these emerging digital health services. We then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases. Methods: We resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way. The ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information. Developers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them. Results: This paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services. On the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts 10 major operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks. Conclusions: It is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand. The process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner.\n",

      "journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/cmpb Background and objectives: Parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification are crucial in computational cardiology, as they enable the construction of digital twins that faithfully replicate the behavior of physical patients. Many model parameters regarding cardiac electromechanics and cardiovascular hemodynamics need to be robustly fitted by starting from a few, possibly non-invasive, noisy observations. Moreover, short execution times and a small amount of computational resources are required for the effective clinical translation. Methods: In the framework of Bayesian statistics, we combine Maximum a Posteriori estimation and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to find an approximation of model parameters and their posterior distributions. Fast simulations and minimal memory requirements are achieved by using an accurate and geometryspecific Artificial Neural Network surrogate model for the cardiac function, matrix-free methods, automatic differentiation and automatic vectorization. Furthermore, we account for the surrogate modeling error and measurement error. Results: We perform three different in silico test cases, ranging from the ventricular function to the entire cardiocirculatory system, involving whole-heart mechanics, arterial and venous hemodynamics. By employing a single central processing unit on a standard laptop, we attain highly accurate estimations for all model parameters in short computational times. Furthermore, we obtain posterior distributions that contain the true values inside the 90% credibility regions. Conclusions: Many model parameters regarding the entire cardiovascular system can be fastly and robustly identified with minimal hardware requirements. This can be achieved when a small amount of non-invasive data is available and when high levels of signal-to-noise ratio are present in the quantities of interest. With these features, our approach meets the requirements for clinical exploitation, while being compliant with Green Computing practices.\n",

      "Fast interactive CFD evaluation of hemodynamics assisted by RBF mesh morphing and reduced order models: the case of aTAA modelling\n",
      "The medical digital twin is emerging as a viable opportunity to provide patient-specific information useful for treatment, prevention and surgical planning. A bottleneck toward its effective use when computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and tools are adopted for the high fidelity prediction of blood flow, is the significant computing cost required. Reduced order models (ROM) looks to be a promising solution for facing the aforementioned limit. In fact, once ROM data processing is accomplished, the consumption stage can be performed outside the computer-aided engineering software adopted for simulation and, in addition, it could be also implemented on interactive software visualization interfaces that are commonly employed in the medical context. In this paper we demonstrate the soundness of such a concept by numerically investigating the effect of the bulge shape for the ascending thoracic aorta aneurysm case. Radial basis functions (RBF) based mesh morphing enables the implementation of a parametric shape, which is used to build up the ROM framework and data. The final result is an inspection tool capable to visualize, interactively and almost in real-time, the effect of shape parameters on the entire flow field. The approach is first verified considering a morphing action representing the progression from an average healthy patient to an average aneurismatic one (Capellini et al. in Proceedings VII Meeting Italian Chapter of the European Society of Biomechanics (ESB-ITA 2017), 2017; Capellini et al. in J. Biomech. Eng. 140(11):111007-1-111007-10, 2018). Then, a set of shape parameters, suitable to consistently represent a widespread number of possible bulge configurations, are defined and accordingly generated. The concept is showcased taking into account the steady flow field at systolic peak conditions, using ANSYS®Fluent®and its ROM environment for CFD and ROM calculations respectively, and the RBF MorphTM software for shape parametrization.\n",

      "1 2 0 Abstract-Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming 2 ubiquitous with a proliferation of smart medical devices and applications used in smart hospitals, smart-home based care, v and nursing homes. It utilizes smart medical devices and cloud o computing services along with core Internet of Things (IoT) Ntechnologies to sense patients' vital body parameters, monitor health conditions and generate multivariate data to support just5 in-time health services.

      "-Hospitals are starting to move away from traditional based-systems to the information technology based-systems. Today, Internet of Things (IoT), Body Sensor Network (BSN), Modeling, Simulation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are core technology elements that will be used in hospital of the future to improve the quality of patient care. Collecting the patient's data and monitoring their states and behavior became mandatory to improve their care. This paper proposes a novel framework for supporting the hospital of the future named HospiT'Win. This framework uses the core technology elements mentioned above to create a digital twin, that is a virtual replica of the hospital, allowing the health care providers to trace the patient's pathways data, monitor their behaviors, and predict their near future outcomes. So that, they can provide the right care in a right place, and in a right time. The paper explains in details the main components, the structure, and the way to synchronize the state and the behavior of the digital twin with the patients pathways in the real hospital. In case of unexpected events, HospiT'Win predicts the near future to see their impact on the real hospital. Moreover, it provides the possible solutions to minimize the impact of these events to preserve the quality of health care inside the hospital.

      "How artificial intelligence might disrupt diagnostics in hematology in the near future\n",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is about to make itself indispensable in the health care sector. Examples of successful applications or promising approaches range from the application of pattern recognition software to pre-process and analyze digital medical images, to deep learning algorithms for subtype or disease classification, and digital twin technology and in silico clinical trials. Moreover, machine-learning techniques are used to identify patterns and anomalies in electronic health records and to perform ad-hoc evaluations of gathered data from wearable health tracking devices for deep longitudinal phenotyping. In the last years, substantial progress has been made in automated image classification, reaching even superhuman level in some instances. Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of the genetic context, the diagnosis in hematology is still mainly based on the evaluation of the phenotype. Either by the analysis of microscopic images of cells in cytomorphology or by the analysis of cell populations in bidimensional plots obtained by flow cytometry. Here, AI algorithms not only spot details that might escape the human eye, but might also identify entirely new ways of interpreting these images. With the introduction of high-throughput next-generation sequencing in molecular genetics, the amount of available information is increasing exponentially, priming the field for the application of machine learning approaches. The goal of all the approaches is to allow personalized and informed interventions, to enhance treatment success, to improve the timeliness and accuracy of diagnoses, and to minimize technically induced misclassifications. The potential of AI-based applications is virtually endless but where do we stand in hematology and how far can we go?\n",

      "Human Digital Twin for Personalized Elderly Type 2 Diabetes Management\n",
      "Managing Elderly type 2 diabetes (E-T2D) is challenging due to geriatric conditions (e.g., comorbidity, multiple drug intake, etc.), and personalization becomes paramount for precision medicine. This paper presents a human digital twin (HDT) framework to manage E-T2D that exploits various patient-specific data and builds a suite of models exploiting the data for prediction and management to personalize diabetes treatment in E-T2D patients. These models include mathematical and deeplearning ones that capture different patient aspects. Consequently, the HDT virtualizes the patient from different viewpoints using an HDT that mimics the patient and has interfaces to update the virtual models simultaneously from measurements. Using these models the HDT obtains deeper insights about the patient. Further, an adaptive patient model fusing this information and a learningbased model predictive control (LB-MPC) algorithm are proposed. The geriatric conditions are captured as model parameters and constraints while solving the LB-MPC to personalize the insulin infusion for E-T2D management. The HDT is deployed on and illustrated with 15 patients using clinical trials and simulations. Our results show that HDT helps improve the time-in-range from 3-75% to 86-97% and reduces insulin infusion by 14-29%.\n",

      "Impact of anatomical reverse remodelling in the design of optimal quadripolar pacing leads: A computational study\n",
      "journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/compbiomed Lead position is an important factor in determining response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) in dyssynchronous heart failure (HF) patients. Multipoint pacing (MPP) enables pacing from multiple electrodes within the same lead, improving the potential outcome for patients. Virtual quadripolar lead designs were evaluated by simulating pacing from all combinations of 1 and 2 electrodes along the lead in each virtual patient from cohorts of HF (n = 24) and simulated reverse remodelled (RR, n = 20) patients. Electrical synchrony was assessed by the time 90% of the ventricular myocardium is activated (AT090). Optimal 1 and 2 electrode pacing configurations for AT090 were combined to identify the 4electrode lead design that maximised benefits across all patients. LV pacing in the HF cohort in all possible single and double electrode locations reduced AT090 by 14.48 ± 5.01 ms (11.92 ± 3.51%). The major determinant of reduction in activation time was patient anatomy. Pacing with a single optimal lead design reduced AT090 more in the HF cohort than the RR cohort (12.68 ± 3.29% vs 10.81 ± 2.34%). Pacing with a single combined HF and RR population-optimised lead design achieves electrical resynchronization with near equivalence to personalised lead designs both in HF and RR anatomies. These findings suggest that although lead configurations have to be tailored to each patient, a single optimal lead design is sufficient to obtain near-optimal results across most patients. This study shows the potential of virtual clinical trials as tools to compare existing and explore new lead designs.\n",

      "Impact of Heterotopic Ossification on Functional Recovery in Acute Spinal Cord Injury\n",
      "Objective: In spinal cord injury (SCI), heterotopic ossification is a frequent secondary complication, commonly associated with limited range of motion of affected joints, which could lead to secondary disability in activities of daily living. Additionally, heterotopic ossifications might challenge the effect of regeneration-promoting therapies on neurological and functional recovery. This study evaluated the impact of heterotopic ossification on clinical recovery within the first year after SCI. Methods: The study was conducted as a monocentric longitudinal paired cohort study. Recruitment was based on consecutive sampling in the framework of the European Multicenter about Spinal Cord Injury (EMSCI). Recovery profiles were determined using standardized neurological and functional clinical assessments within the 1st year following SCI. All study participants underwent at least two comprehensive standardized neurological and functional clinical examinations according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI and the Spinal Cord Independence Measure, respectively. Data regarding the diagnosis and treatment of heterotopic ossification were obtained by reviewing the patient medical records. The most similar “digital twin” from the entire EMSCI database were matched in terms of age, acute neurological and functional status to each individual with SCI, and heterotopic ossification. Results: Out of 25 participants diagnosed with heterotopic ossification, 13 individuals were enrolled and matched to control individuals. Most individuals presented with motor complete injury (75%). Ossifications were most frequently located at the hip joints (92%) and mainly occurred within the first 3 months after SCI. Individuals with heterotopic ossification achieved around 40% less functional improvement over time compared to their matched counterparts, whereas neurological recovery was not altered in individuals with SCI and heterotopic ossification. Conclusion: Heterotopic ossification-a common complication of SCI-unfavorably affects functional recovery, which in the end is most relevant for the best possible degree of independence in activities of daily living. Upon presentation with heterotopic ossification, neurological improvement achieved through potential restorative therapies\n",

      "Impact of industry 4.0 on healthcare systems of low‑ and middle‑ income countries: a systematic review\n",
      "Purpose A growing body of empirical research has emerged, focused on leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies to develop and optimise systems within various operational contexts, including healthcare delivery. However, even though a significant number of studies have been published on application of digital technologies in enhancing delivery and health outcomes of health systems, systematic studies that review how extensively these technologies have been applied within a low- and middle-income economies' context remain scarce in the literature. This work attempts to close that gap by investigating the impact of industry 4.0 on healthcare systems in emerging economies. Methods The study follows a systematic review approach and uses PRISMA guidelines to conduct the research and synthesise its findings. A final sample of 72 articles is selected for in-depth review following a systematic screening from an initial list of 597 results. Results The study successfully synthesises the latest research in the subject area and reveals that, hitherto, approaches to use of digital tools have been fragmented and thus unable to provide holistic optimisation solutions for healthcare systems in low-resource settings. The analysis exposes a heavy skew towards adoption of mobile health and telemedicine technologies, with conspicuous research gaps in the use of augmented reality, additive manufacturing as well as simulation and digital twin technologies. Conclusions The study provides researchers, health-care practitioners and systems engineers with knowledge on the stateof-the-art in healthcare systems optimisation and points out research gaps that may be addressed through future empirical studies.\n",

      "-Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a novel framework, iPhantom, for automated creation of patient-specific phantoms or “digital-twins (DT)” using patient medical images. The framework is applied to assess radiation dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method: Given a volume of patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs and structures (e.g., liver, bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT segmentation. Organs which are challenging to segment (e.g., intestines) are incorporated from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting digital-twin phantoms are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was validated on both with a set of XCAT digital phantoms (n = 50) and an independent clinical dataset (n = 10) with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations yielding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) 0.6 - 1 for anchor organs and DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed <10% errors in estimated radiation dose for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art baseline method (20-35% dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time, provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application of CHPs (computational human phantoms) to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving wide and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, personalized optimization, and large-scale research.\n",

      "In this work, we propose a methodology to detect the severity of carotid stenosis from a video of a human face with the help of a coupled blood flow and head vibration model. This semi-active digital twin model is an attempt to link noninvasive video of a patient face to the percentage of carotid occlusion. The pulsatile nature of blood flow through the carotid arteries induces a subtle head vibration. This vibration is a potential indicator of carotid stenosis severity, and it is exploited in the present study. A head vibration model has been proposed in the present work that is linked to the forces generated by blood flow with or without occlusion. The model is used to generate a large number of virtual head vibration data for different degrees of occlusion. In order to determine the in vivo head vibration, a computer vision algorithm is adopted to use human face videos. The in vivo vibrations are compared against the virtual vibration data generated from the coupled computational blood flow/vibration model. A comparison of the in vivo vibration is made against the virtual data to find the best fit between in vivo and virtual data. The preliminary results on healthy subjects and a patient clearly indicate that the model is accurate and it possesses the potential for detecting approximate severity of carotid artery stenoses.\n",

      "Advances in ventricular assist device (VAD) technology for the treatment of end-stage congestive heart failure (CHF) are needed to cope with the increasing numbers of patients that cannot be provided with donor hearts for transplantation. We develop and investigate a novel extravascular VAD technology that provides biventricular, epicardial pressure support for the failing heart. This novel VAD concept avoids blood contact that is accompanied with typical complications such as coagulation and infections. To date, in vivo porcine model results with a prototype of the implant exist, further studies to improve the implant's performance and promote its applicability in humans are needed. In this contribution, we present a personalised functional digital twin of the heart, the vascular system, and the novel VAD technology in terms of a calibrated, customized computational model. The calibration procedure is based on patient-specific measurements and is performed by solving an inverse problem. This in silico model is able to (a) confirm in vivo experimental data, (b) predict healthy and pathologic ventricular function, and (c) assess the beneficial impact of the novel VAD concept to a high level of fidelity. The model shows very good agreement with in vivo data and reliably predicts increases in stroke volume and left ventricular pressure with increasing ventricular support. Furthermore, the digital twin allows insight into quantities that are poorly or not at all amenable in any experimental setup. Conclusively, the model's ability to link integral hemodynamic variables to local tissue mechanical deformation makes it a highly valuable tool for the dimensioning of novel VAD technologies and future treatment strategies in heart failure. The presented in silico twin enhances in vivo studies by facilitating the accessibility and increasing the range of quantities of interest. Because of its flexibility in the assessment of design variants and optimization loops, it may substantially contribute to a reduction of the amount of animal experiments in this and similar settings.\n",

      "A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical asset reproducing its data model, its behaviour and its communication with other physical assets. Digital twins act as a digital replica for the physical object or process they represent, providing nearly real-time monitoring and evaluation without being in close proximity. Although most of their concrete applications can be found mainly in the industrial context, healthcare represents another relevant area where digital twins can have a disruptive impact. The main research question tackled by this paper is about the integration of digital twins with agents and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) technologies in healthcare. After providing an overview of the application of digital twins in healthcare, in this paper, we discuss our vision about agent-based digital twins, and we present a first case study, about the application of agent-based digital twins to the management of severe traumas.\n",

      "Reliable Numerical Models of Nickel-Titanium Stents: How to Deduce the Specific Material Properties from Testing Real Devices\n",
      "-The current interest of those dealing with medical research is the preparation of digital twins. In this frame, the first step to accomplish is the preparation of reliable numerical models. This is a challenging task since it is not common to know the exact device geometry and material properties unless in studies performed in collaboration with the manufacturer. The particular case of modeling Ni-Ti stents can be highlighted as a worst-case scenario due to both the complex geometrical features and non-linear material response. Indeed, if the limitations in the description of the geometry can be overcome, many difficulties still exist in the assessment of the material, which can vary according to the manufacturing process and requires many parameters for its description. The purpose of this work is to propose a coupled experimental and computational workflow to identify the set of material properties in the case of commercially-resembling Ni-Ti stents. This has been achieved from non-destructive tensile tests on the devices compared with results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A surrogate modeling approach is proposed for the identification of the material parameters, based on a minimization problem on the database of responses of Ni-Ti materials obtained with FEA with a series of different parameters. The reliability of the final result was validated through the comparison with the output of additional experiments.\n",

      "Signal-Based Metamodels for Predictive Reliability Analysis and Virtual Testing\n",
      "A B S T R A C T In the current industrial development, an increasing number of sensors is applied for monitoring of any kind of appliances and machines. A predictive mathematical model allows for realistic assessment of the health state of the appliance, indication of service requirements, as well as control of the appliance, serving as so-called digital twin on a control device. Completely analogous modeling can be used for virtual testing, i.e. a (partial) substitution of physical experiments. The software-in-the-loop model provides realistic feedback to the physical specimen on the test rig and helps to increase the representativeness of the experiment and to reduce costs. In a joint research project partially sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy, the authors developed an approach for meta-modeling of dynamic systems. While the modeling process is fed by results from sophisticated simulations, or even test results as input data, the resulting model can be used for fast stochastic analyses as well as software-in-the-loop in dynamic real-time experiments. The approach was verified on tests of an aircraft high lift system.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic created the need for telerehabilitation development, while Industry 4.0 brought the key technology. As motor therapy often requires the physical support of a patient's motion, combining robot-aided workouts with remote control is a promising solution. This may be realised with the use of the device's digital twin, so as to give it an immersive operation. This paper presents an extensive overview of this technology's applications within the fields of industry and health. It is followed by the in-depth analysis of needs in rehabilitation based on questionnaire research and bibliography review. As a result of these sections, the original concept of controlling a rehabilitation exoskeleton via its digital twin in the virtual reality is presented. The idea is assessed in terms of benefits and significant challenges regarding its application in real life. The presented aspects prove that it may be potentially used for manual remote kinesiotherapy, combined with the safety systems predicting potentially harmful situations. The concept is universally applicable to rehabilitation robots.\n",

      "Synthetic PPG generation from haemodynamic model with baroreflex autoregulation: a Digital twin of cardiovascular system\n",
      "- Synthetic data generation has recently emerged as a substitution technique for handling the problem of bulk data needed in training machine learning algorithms. Healthcare, primarily cardiovascular domain is a major area where synthetic physiological data like Photoplethysmogram (PPG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Phonocardiogram (PCG), etc. are being used to improve accuracy of machine learning algorithm. Conventional synthetic data generation approach using mathematical formulations lack interpretability. Hence, aim of this paper is to generate synthetic PPG signal from a Digital twin platform replicating cardiovascular system. Such system can serve the dual purpose of replicating the physical system, so as to simulate specific 'what if' scenarios as well as to generate large scale synthetic data with patho-physiological interpretability. Cardio-vascular Digital twin is modeled with a two chambered heart, haemodynamic equations and a baroreflex based pressure control mechanism to generate blood pressure and flow variations. Synthetic PPG signal is generated from the model for healthy and Atherosclerosis condition. Initial validation of the platform has been made on the basis of efficiency of the platform in clustering Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and non CAD PPG data by extracting features from the synthetically generated PPG and comparing that with PPG obtained from Physionet data.\n",

      "OPEN ACCESS Cognitive decline is a gradual neurodegenerative process that is a ected by genetic and environmental factors. The doctor-patient relationship in the healthcare for cognitive decline is in a “shallow” medical world. With the development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the co-construction of community partners.\n",

We herein discuss how genetic information combined with longitudinal metabolomic, immune, behavioral, and gut microbial parameters, and bioclinical variables could define a digital replica of oneself, a “virtual digital twin,” which could serve to guide nutrition in a personalized manner.

      "Theranostic digital twins for personalized radiopharmaceutical therapies: Reimagining theranostics via computational nuclear oncology\n",
      "OPEN ACCESS This work emphasizes that patient data, including images, are not operable (clinically), but that digital twins are. Based on the former, the latter can be created. Subsequently, virtual clinical operations can be performed towards selection of optimal therapies. Digital twins are beginning to emerge in the field of medicine. We suggest that theranostic digital twins (TDTs) are amongst the most natural and feasible flavors of digitals twins. We elaborate on the importance of TDTs in a future where 'one-size-fits-all' therapeutic schemes, as prevalent nowadays, are transcended in radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). Personalized RPTs will be deployed, including optimized intervention parameters. Examples include optimization of injected radioactivities, sites of injection, injection intervals and profiles, and combination therapies. Multimodal multi-scale images, combined with other data and aided by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, will be utilized towards routine digital twinning of our patients, and will enable improved deliveries of RPTs and overall healthcare.\n",

      "Towards enabling a cardiovascular digital twin for human systemic circulation using inverse analysis\n",
      "An exponential rise in patient data provides an excellent opportunity to improve the existing health care infrastructure. In the present work, a method to enable cardiovascular digital twin is proposed using inverse analysis. Conventionally, accurate analytical solutions for inverse analysis in linear problems have been proposed and used. However, these methods fail or are not eficient for nonlinear systems, such as blood flow in the cardiovascular system (systemic circulation) that involves high degree of nonlinearity. To address this, a methodology for inverse analysis using recurrent neural network for the cardiovascular system is proposed in this work, using a virtual patient database. Blood pressure waveforms in various vessels of the body are inversely calculated with the help of long short-term memory (LSTM) cells by inputting pressure waveforms from three non-invasively accessible blood vessels (carotid, femoral and brachial arteries). The inverse analysis system built this way is applied to the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and its severity using neural networks.\n",

      "Type 2 diabetes reversal with digital twin technology-enabled precision nutrition and staging of reversal: a retrospective cohort study\n",
      "Background: Type 2 diabetes reversal has been viewed in the literature primarily as a dichotomous event (reversed or not reversed), even though this viewpoint may not be optimal for clinicians or patients. This cohort study's objectives were to define stages of type 2 diabetes reversal and measure changes in reversal stages before and after 90 days of digital twin-enabled precision nutrition therapy. Methods: This study defines seven stages of diabetes reversal. The study is a retrospective pre/post comparison of changes in reversal stage, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, body mass index (BMI), and other metrics measured before and after precision nutrition therapy. Reversal stages were defined as Stage 0: HbA1c < 5.7% without medication for > 1 year, Stage 1: HbA1c < 5.7% without medication for < 1 year, Stage 2: HbA1c < 6.5% without medication, Stage 3: estimated HbA1c (eA1c) between 5.7 and 6.4% without medication, Stage 4: estimated HbA1c (eA1c) between 5.7 and 6.4% with metformin monotherapy, Stage 5: dual oral therapy, Stage 6: > = 3 medications. Results: Reversal stage information was available for 463 patients at baseline and 90 days. At baseline, the proportions of patients in each reversal stage were Stages 1 and 2: 0%, Stage 3: 1%, Stage 4: 8%, Stage 5: 6%, and Stage 6: 85%. After 90 days, the proportions in each reversal stage were Stage 1: 2%, Stage 2: 9%, Stage 3: 32%, Stage 4: 39%, Stage 5: 7%, and Stage 6: 11%, indicating significant progress. Reversal stage progression rates varied by patient subgroup. Conclusions: Type 2 diabetes patients reached diefring reversal stages during 90 days of precision nutrition therapy. Use of reversal stages may benefit patients during therapy. Trial registration: This was a retrospective study that was approved by the Medisys Clinisearch Ethical Review Board (without registration number) in 2019.\n",

      "Using Interactive Fiction to Teach Clinical Decision‑Making in a PharmD Curriculum\n",
      "Teaching of clinical decision-making is an important component of health professions education. Patient case examples are widely used in didactic coursework to teach this material, but engaging all learners in large, lecture-based courses remains a challenge. Interactive fiction (IF), a digital choose-your-own-adventure media, provides an accessible way for students to individually explore the narrative of a patient-case in a safe environment. Here, we report the development of interactive, digital patient-cases (eCases) using Twine, a free IF development platform. Fourteen eCases were developed in collaboration with 11 faculty members and were used in seven diefrent PharmD courses over three semesters. eCase content was developed by faculty members for their respective instructional topics and accessed via Web browsers on students' personal electronic devices. eCases were received positively by students, with > 90% of students reporting that eCases were easy to use, helped them learn the material at their own pace, and gave them an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Student self-perceived confidence also increased significantly after eCase use. Faculty reported that eCases took more time to develop than conventional cases, but were easier to deliver and provided better student engagement. IF is an accessible media for creating and delivering low-fidelity interactive patient cases that can engage all students in a large class. eCases allow students to apply their knowledge, practice clinical decision-making, and safely learn from their mistakes. eCases are versatile and well suited for both in-person and virtual teaching across a variety of health professions programs to teach clinical decision-making.\n",

      "Visual Parameter Space Analysis for Optimizing the Quality of Industrial Nonwovens\n",
      "Technical textiles, in particular, nonwovens used, for example, in medical masks, have become increasingly important in our daily lives. The quality of these textiles depends on the manufacturing process parameters that cannot be easily optimized in live settings. In this article, we present a visual analytics framework that enables interactive parameter space exploration and parameter optimization in industrial production processes of nonwovens. Therefore, we survey analysis strategies used in optimizing industrial production processes of nonwovens and support them in our tool. To enable real-time interaction, we augment the digital twin with a machine learning surrogate model for rapid quality computations. In addition, we integrate mechanisms for sensitivity analysis that ensure consistent product quality under mild parameter changes. In our case study, we explore the finding of optimal parameter sets, investigate the input-output relationship between parameters, and conduct a sensitivity analysis to find settings that result in robust quality.\n",
