', 'As a result, nowadays there are methods and techniques for predicting the possible appearance of the AH in ', 'humans and generating preventive strategies to avoid disease development in high risk social groups [1][2]. In ', 'particular, Polak et al. [1] applied a multilayer perceptron to predict AH manifestation in humans using neural ', 'network six input characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), bad habits presence, diet, and physical ', 'activity level). The authors of this work state that the developed model can be a useful tool for Internet screening ', 'focused on mass health examination. In work [3] the researchers conducted meta-analysis of 15 regression models ', 'predicting the risk of AH developing, where predictor variables were the risk factors known from the evidence- ', 'based medicine, such as: age, gender, BMI, diabetes, and blood pressure level. This comparative analysis ', 'represented that most of the analyzed models have an acceptable generalizing ability calculated on test samples ', 'using C-statistics (C-statistic (“concordance” statistic) > 0.7). Framingham and Hopkins models were determined by ', 'the authors as the most accurate. ', 'Moreover, AH is characterized by different types and often accompanied by diverse comorbidities predisposing ', 'to development of AH and exacerbating the course of the disease. Therefore the risk assessment of AH development ', 'in patients suffering from other diseases is an important issue [4]. Particularly, in study [5] the authors predicted the ', 'risk of AH development for patients diagnosed with type II diabetes, and inverse, the risk of type II diabetes ', 'development in hypertensive patients. In work [6], the authors investigated the problem of the AH forms ', 'differentiation to improve diagnosis precision. The authors solved problem in terms of patients multi-output ', 'classification, and 904 patient electronic health records (EHRs) containing 12 forms of AH and 129 symptoms were ', 'used to build the classification model. ', 'Uncontrolled AH substantially increases ten-year risks of subclinical organ damage and fatal cardiovascular ', 'diseases [7]. Thus, techniques design for simulation of AH development process and predictive modelling of ', 'treatment outcome is necessary to reduce uncertainty within the conditions of clinical decision making. In current ', 'study, we propose an approach for data-driven identifying hypertensive patient profiles with the aim of further ', 'hypertensive patient population simulation.
