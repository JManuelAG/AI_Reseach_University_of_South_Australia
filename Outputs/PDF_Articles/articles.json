        "Abstract": "TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background: Industry 4.0 presents itself as an ecosystem; a collection of elements endowed with Cyber-Physical Systems and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, which are connected through the Internet of Things, and uploaded to Cloud Platforms for analysis, knowledge extraction, and diagnostics through Cognitive Computing based on a large amount of data.\nThe concept is centered around data: managing data, analyzing data, and controlling data.\nMany factors influence this interconnected working environment, and for that reason planning and implementing the digital transformation implies many challenges.\nIndustry 4.0 and Ergonomics are being integrated using a variety of tools and approaches, thus supporting the development of an Ergonomics 4.0 concept.\nPurpose: This paper reviews studies focusing on the determinants of Ergonomics 4.0, identifying the main elements and their interrelationships with a focus on Digital Human Modeling and Cyber-Physical Systems.\nWe consider approaches such as Operator 4.0 and \u2018Modeling and Simulation for Digital Twin Creation\u2019, which aim to accelerate the decisionmaking and adaptation processes.\nWe identify the leading technologies, operations, and worker-related aspects through a qualitative meta-analysis, to establish elements and interrelationships of Ergonomics 4.0 determinants.\nMethods: Literature was selected from articles recent journal publications, and a qualitative evaluation was performed using semantic meta-analysis.\nThe findings were then used to develop a theoretical taxonomy of determinants of Ergonomics 4.0 in Industry 4.0 based on various classifiers, which were structured and interlinked.\nResults: The five areas categorized include: Industry 4.0 technology, Human-Cyber-Physical Systems, Operator 4.0, Human-Robot collaboration, Digital Twin and Digital Human Modeling.\nThe proposed conceptual framework for Ergonomics 4.0 describes processes, technology, information, and structures, which occur in Industry 4.0 as Operator 4.0, Human-Robot collaboration, Digital Twin, Digital Human Modeling and eventually define Ergonomics 4.0.\nThe concepts of Digital Twin and Digital Human Modeling are analyzed in detail, as they form the core of Ergonomics 4.0.\nConclusions: We propose a conceptual framework for Ergonomics 4.0 as a Cyber-Physical System and discuss aspects of Digital Human Modeling and Digital Twin that are essential to understanding the role of Ergonomics and the integration of Ergonomics into Industry 4.0."

As the knowledge base on cancer, cellular transduction and molecular interactions widens, so does our ability to generate computational models with the capacity to accurately represent the complex networks and cross-talk determining cancer progression and drug response [            hTe main advantages of mechanistic models are the integration of data from Currently, we are at an inflection point in which advances in technology, decreases in the costs of sequencing and other molecular analyses, and increases in computing advances are converging, forming the foundation to build a data-driven approach to personalized oncology.\nIn this article we discuss the deep molecular characterization of individual tumors and patients as the basis of not only current precision oncology but also of computational models (\u2018digital twins\u2019), the foundation for a truly personalized therapy selection of the future."

        "Abstract": " 1 INTRODUCTION          In the last 30 years, Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery (MIRS) has become an important technology in modern medicine.\nIt leverages the advantages of minimal invasive surgery, such as shorter recovery times for patients, and avoids several of its disadvantages for the surgeons, such as the interrupted hand-eye coordination and the loss of Degrees of Freedom (DoF) inside the patient\u2019s body                   Exploitation of commonly used haptic input devices, for instance by means of Virtual Fixtures (VFs), is one possibility in which the surgeon\u2019s performance can be further augmented.\nHowever, VFs have to be parameterized according to the context of the task at hand in order to provide reasonable assistance.\nDue to the unstructured dynamic environment inside the patient\u2019s body, automatic perception of the procedural context in a real surgery remains challenging          Our approach introduces a Digital Twin (DT) to monitor procedural context information during training.\nBased on this, we propose a novel concept for the on-line parametrization of haptically rendered assistance functions using VFs.\nThis preserves the dexterity of the surgeon and adds an additional feedback channel to the visual one.\nWe hypothesize that training with our approach enables a novice surgeon to realize a task faster, more accurately and with less cognitive load.\nThe main contributions of this article are 1) an approach to estimate geometric and semantic task states using a DT that mirrors the real robotic system, 2) a novel way to flexibly parameterize assistance functions online based on the estimation of the current semantic task states, 3) the combination of both methods to assist in training for MIRS using multi-modal support, and 4) an evaluation in a proof-of-concept experiment in surgical training.\nThis work is divided into the following sections.\nSection 2 further motivates our work based on the current state of the art.\nThe methods used in our approach are explained in Section 3 followed by the description of the pilot study and its results in Section 4.\nSection 5 presents the conclusions and an outlook."

        "Abstract": "Abstract. 30 million people across Europe are affected approximately from rare diseases.\nThe brain disorders (including, but not limited to those affecting mental health) remain a major challenge.\nThe understanding of mental disorders' determinants and causes, processes and impacts is a key to their prevention, early detection and treatment as well as factor for good health and well-being.\nIn order to improve the health and disease understanding, a close linkage between fundamental, clinical, epidemiological and socio-economic research is required.\nEffective sharing of data, standardized data processing and the linkage of such data with large-scale cohort studies is a prerequisite for translation of research findings into the clinic.\nIn this context, this paper proposes a platform for exploration of behavioral changes in patients with proven cognitive disorders with a focus on Multiple Sclerosis.\nIt adopts the concept of a digital twin by applying the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to allow for deep analysis of medical data to estimate human health status, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients.\nThe platform has two main components.\nThe first component, provides functionality for diagnostics and rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis and acts as a main provider of data for the second component.\nThe second component is an advanced analytical application, which provides services for data aggregation, enrichment, analysis and visualization that will be used to produce a new knowledge and support decision in each instance of the transactional component."

        "Abstract": " INTRODUCTION The efficacy of the guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been proven by four randomized controlled trials (RCT) on gFOBT1\u20134 and three service screening programs on the fecal immunological test (FIT)5\u20137 but there still exists large uncertainty of overdiagnosis8, which is one of the demerits of population-based service screening that has already been noted in the PSA (prostate-specific antigen)9\u201311.\nPrevious studies on population-based CRC screening with gFOBT found 2%-13% overdiagnosis when the incidence method was applied to data from both the Nottingham trial and the Finnish trial12,13.\nSuch an incidence method is valuable but must rely on the use of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to compare the expected CRC cases derived from the screened group with those from the control group as shown in Fig. 1a.\nWhile g-FOBT has data on RCT, it still lacks RCT data for FIT screening.\nEvaluating overdiagnosis in two-stage FIT service screening for CRC is therefore faced with these obstacles.\nThe alternative to the RCT approach for assessing the extent of overdiagnosis in service screening program is to use the modelling approach as already applied to PSA screening for prostate of tumor development that is inherent to a multi-stage biological process due to environmental exposures and genetic susceptibility16, which may either accelerate or slow down the process, making allowance for competing mortality.\nTherefore, the definition of overdiagnosis not only comprises non-progressive cancers that develop slowly and remain in the pre-clinical state (extremely slowly-growing tumor) but also progressive cancers that were detected in the pre-clinical state but died from other causes17.\nIn addition to using a computer simulation approach, quantifying the extent of overdiagnosis can be escalated up to a study design level in conjunction with machine learning algorithms for estimating relevant parameters governing the overdiagnosis-embedded disease natural process.\nOne approach relies on the recently proposed digital twin approach, which arose from the quantifiedself phenomenon to promote the value of self-monitoring made possible by emerging digital technologies for data acquisition and self-reflection18.\nIts applications include international space the digital twin was realized in the realm of cancer prevention and screening by the parallel universe approach, which has already"

        "Abstract": "a b s t r a c t Conventional approaches to developing biomaterials and implants require intuitive tailoring of manufacturing protocols and biocompatibility assessment.\nThis leads to longer development cycles, and high costs.\nTo meet existing and unmet clinical needs, it is critical to accelerate the production of implantable biomaterials, implants and biomedical devices.\nBuilding on the Materials Genome Initiative, we define the concept 'biomaterialomics' as the integration of multi-omics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools throughout the entire pipeline of biomaterials development.\nThe Data Science-driven approach is envisioned to bring together on a single platform, the computational tools, databases, experimental methods, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing (e.g., 3D printing) to develop the fourth-generation biomaterials and implants, whose clinical performance will be predicted using 'digital twins'.\nWhile analysing the key elements of the concept of 'biomaterialomics', significant emphasis has been put forward to effectively utilize high-throughput biocompatibility data together with multiscale physics-based models, E-platform/online databases of clinical studies, data science approaches, including metadata management, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and uncertainty predictions.\nSuch integrated formulation will allow one to adopt cross-disciplinary approaches to establish processingstructure-property (PSP) linkages.\nA few published studies from the lead author's research group serve as representative examples to illustrate the formulation and relevance of the 'Biomaterialomics' approaches for three emerging research themes, i.e.\npatient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine.\nThe increased adaptability of AI/ML tools in biomaterials science along with the training of the next generation researchers in data science are strongly recommended.\nStatement of significance This leading opinion review paper emphasizes the need to integrate the concepts and algorithms of the data science with biomaterials science.\nAlso, this paper emphasizes the need to establish a mathematically rigorous cross-disciplinary framework that will allow a systematic quantitative exploration and curation of critical biomaterials knowledge needed to drive objectively the innovation efforts within a suitable uncertainty quantification framework, as embodied in 'biomaterialomics' concept, which integrates multiomics data and high-dimensional analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) tools, like machine learning.\nThe formulation of this approach has been demonstrated for patient-specific implants, additive manufacturing, and bioelectronic medicine."

        "Abstract": "Abstract Phase I oncology clinical trials often comprise a limited number of patients representing different disease subtypes who are divided into cohorts receiving treatment(s) at different dosing levels and schedules.\nHere, we leverage a previously developed quantitative systems pharmacology model of the anti-CD20/CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibody, mosunetuzumab, to account for different dosing regimens and patient heterogeneity in the phase I study to inform clinical dose/exposure-response relationships and to identify biological determinants of clinical response.\nWe developed a novel workflow to generate digital twins for each patient, which together form a virtual population (VPOP) that represented variability in biological, pharmacological, and tumor-related parameters from the phase I trial.\nSimulations based on the VPOP predict that an increase in mosunetuzumab exposure increases the proportion of digital twins with at least a 50% reduction in tumor size by day 42.\nSimulations also predict a left-shift of the exposure-response in patients diagnosed with indolent compared to aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subtype; this increased sensitivity in indolent NHL was attributed to the lower inferred values of tumor proliferation rate and baseline T-cell infiltration in the corresponding digital twins.\nNotably, the inferred digital twin parameters from clinical responders and nonresponders show that the potential biological difference that can influence response include tumor parameters (tumor size, proliferation rate, and baseline T-cell infiltration) and parameters defining the effect of mosunetuzumab on T-cell activation and B-cell killing.\nFinally, the model simulations suggest intratumor expansion of Saroja Ramanujan and Iraj Hosseini are co-senior authors.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made."

        "Abstract": "Executive Summary The digital twin technology is experiencing increasing popularity and is being applied in fields such as manufacturing, product lifecycle management, prognostics and health management, waste management, and smart cities.\nA digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical product, consisting of three main components: the physical object, its virtual equivalent, and the data connection between the physical and the virtual entity.\nDigital twins support the physical system regarding maintenance, prediction, and simulation.\nHealthcare is an up-andcoming, yet relatively uncharted and complex field of application for digital twins as the physical object is the human.\nThis master thesis aims to explore how digital twins can be implemented in healthcare in a privacy friendly manner.\nFirstly, specific privacy challenges associated with digital twins in healthcare are identified.\nSecondly, the influence of the identified privacy risks on the implementation of digital twins is of interest.\nFor this purpose, an adapted step-by-step process based on Requirements Engineering serves as the underlying methodological approach to identify essential prerequisites from stakeholders while uncovering the challenges that digital twins in healthcare pose.\nWithin these steps, semi-structured expert interviews with six participants knowledgeable in the field of digital twins, digital twins in healthcare, and privacy studies are conducted.\nThe findings gathered in the interviews are analysed using Mayring\u2019s approach for qualitative text analysis and are interpreted in relation to relevant literature and theories in the field of digital health and digital twins.\nFinally, the insights are discussed critically and assembled into a model.\nThe outcome is a visualisation of the digital twin infrastructure that includes the main components in the physical and virtual space, as well as their relationship with another.\nAdditionally, the challenges and privacy friendly design strategies to counteract the issues are included.\nThis conceptual framework of the implementation of digital twins in the field of healthcare acts as a guide on what needs to be taken into consideration when developing such technology and serves as a source for further research in the field of digital twins in the health domain."

        "Abstract": "Abstract In this paper, I discuss how the development of digital health technologies changes our understanding of health and illness.\nDigital technologies are transgressive in important ways: They go beyond curative and preventive medicine and cross over to a kind of medicine that caters to desires of enhancement and optimisation of the human body.\nDigital medicine is, first and foremost, a vision: it refers not only to existing technologies, but also to prospective ones.\nDigital medicine makes a promise: If we succeed with integrating medical knowledge and health related data in a comprehensive way, better therapies and the prevention of illness will be possible.\nOne of the manifestations of this vision are medical avatars.\nSuch digital twins are virtual representations of physiological and psychological conditions of patients and provide a basis for a simulation of health-related processes and the evaluation of therapeutic measures.\nUsing vision assessment as a method, it is the task of sociological analysis to discuss the wider implications of emerging technologies before they materialise.\nIt is of particular interest to study digital health technology as enabler of a comprehensive monitoring and simulation as well as the ways in which they change the mode of intervention in medical practice.\nAnother thing that digital health technologies are changing are traditional conceptions of autonomous subjects.\nHealth becomes a quantifiable target and a practice of optimisation.\nThis, in turn, promotes the economisation of the social, and changes what we do in order to maintain our health and cure or prevent diseases in fundamental ways."

Digital twins is a multimedia convergence technology which represents a digital replica of any living or non-living physical entity [          We believe that the proposed DTwins ecosystem will accelerate the convergence of and dynamic interplay between IoT, big data, communications mechanisms, security and multimodal interaction with the ultimate target of better eHealth care services to empower subjects\u2019 wellness and enhance their quality of life."

        "Abstract": "Abstract Background: The concept of digital twins has great potential for transforming the existing health care system by making it more personalized.\nAs a convergence of health care, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technologies, personalized health care services that are developed under the concept of digital twins raise a myriad of ethical issues.\nAlthough some of the ethical issues are known to researchers working on digital health and personalized medicine, currently, there is no comprehensive review that maps the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services.\nObjective: This study aims to fill the research gap by identifying the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services.\nWe first propose a working definition for digital twins for personalized health care services to facilitate future discussions on the ethical issues related to these emerging digital health services.\nWe then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases.\nMethods: We resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way.\nThe ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information.\nDevelopers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them.\nResults: This paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services.\nOn the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts Conclusions: It is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand.\nThe process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT There are significant challenges in global healthcare delivery at the moment.\nSome countries have abundant services, but are stuck with a rather nimble and expensive system that focuses on incremental innovations.\nOther geographies are still in need of basic tools, infrastructure and require completely different, inexpensive, and with that more disruptive solutions to satisfy their healthcare needs.\nNext Generation Healthcare systems with a focus on prevention / early detection and pro-active therapy will employ exponential technologies (AI, Big Data, Blockchain, Sensor Technology, Synthetic Biology, Tissue Engineering, Robotics, 3D Printing, ...) that will surely lead to significant changes in the way we experience, think about, and deliver healthcare and in which a digitally empowered patient will play a more important role.\nIn the coming years/decades we will experience a shift from the current SICK-CARE provision to real HEALTHCARE to a focus on personal HEALTH, supported by an integration of patient generated health data with other external diagnostic and therapeutic data components creating a digital health twin as a base for prevention and patient centered precision medicine.\nEducation and training of Biomedical Engineers needs to be adjusted to these developments focussing on solving unmet clinical needs, which requires a solid understanding of current health problems (regional, global), future technologies, economic realities and global health markets.\nThe paper will present and discuss some of these future global innovation needs and the subsequent need for a change in the biomedical engineering curriculum that needs to include learning- (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration) and life skills (flexibility, leadership, social), as well as basic economic and entrepreneurial training - all of which are currently not taught or emphasized."

As predicted by Gartner1 the amount spent on IoMT by number of smart medical devices increase, a tremendous amount of data is being collected from these devices which raises major security and privacy concerns in the IoMT domain.\nIn this paper, we mainly focus on anomaly detection models to identify malicious users, devices, and data generated from these users or devices (e.g., user behavior patterns, device data for poisoning AD model, etc.).\nIn the past, various Anomaly Detection (AD) models [          Despite advances in AD models for the RPM ecosystem, there are still growing concerns about safety, security and privacy of users.\nTherefore, this ecosystem requires a comprehensive and robust anomaly detection approach to detect anomalous behavior of various entities effectively.\nGenerally, centralized AD models face many challenges in terms of security and privacy, such as patient data privacy, training data poisoning, model drift, and performance overhead as discussed in detail in the Section III.\nIn this paper, we raise the following research questions (RQs): RQ1 - While developing AD models for smart healthcare, how to enhance patients\u2019 data privacy?"

        "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose A growing body of empirical research has emerged, focused on leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies to develop and optimise systems within various operational contexts, including healthcare delivery.\nHowever, even though a significant number of studies have been published on application of digital technologies in enhancing delivery and health outcomes of health systems, systematic studies that review how extensively these technologies have been applied within a low- and middle-income economies' context remain scarce in the literature.\nThis work attempts to close that gap by investigating the impact of industry 4.0 on healthcare systems in emerging economies.\nMethods The study follows a systematic review approach and uses PRISMA guidelines to conduct the research and synthesise its findings.\nA final sample of 72 articles is selected for in-depth review following a systematic screening from an initial list of 597 results.\nResults The study successfully synthesises the latest research in the subject area and reveals that, hitherto, approaches to use of digital tools have been fragmented and thus unable to provide holistic optimisation solutions for healthcare systems in low-resource settings.\nThe analysis exposes a heavy skew towards adoption of mobile health and telemedicine technologies, with conspicuous research gaps in the use of augmented reality, additive manufacturing as well as simulation and digital twin technologies.\nConclusions The study provides researchers, health-care practitioners and systems engineers with knowledge on the stateof-the-art in healthcare systems optimisation and points out research gaps that may be addressed through future empirical studies."

        "Abstract": "Abstract-The current interest of those dealing with medical research is the preparation of digital twins.\nIn this frame, the first step to accomplish is the preparation of reliable numerical models.\nThis is a challenging task since it is not common to know the exact device geometry and material properties unless in studies performed in collaboration with the manufacturer.\nThe particular case of modeling Ni-Ti stents can be highlighted as a worst-case scenario due to both the complex geometrical features and non-linear material response.\nIndeed, if the limitations in the description of the geometry can be overcome, many difficulties still exist in the assessment of the material, which can vary according to the manufacturing process and requires many parameters for its description.\nThe purpose of this work is to propose a coupled experimental and computational workflow to identify the set of material properties in the case of commercially-resembling Ni-Ti stents.\nThis has been achieved from non-destructive tensile tests on the devices compared with results from Finite Element Analysis (FEA).\nA surrogate modeling approach is proposed for the identification of the material parameters, based on a minimization problem on the database of responses of Ni-Ti materials obtained with FEA with a series of different parameters.\nThe reliability of the final result was validated through the comparison with the output of additional experiments."

What if I prescribe treatment plan B? What about plan C, and so on.\nDigital twins are virtual avatars of individual patients designed precisely to aid with that.\nThey are not merely images.\nThey embody biological and physiological relationships.\nThey will not fit existing DICOM formats, as we are used to for images.\nThis is not about manipulating images as we are used to with existing powerful software, but about experimenting with digital versions of our patients, i.e.\nvirtual therapies, to answer questions about therapy effects and to propose optimal treatments for individual patients.          Digital twins have been used extensively in engineering for years, and oncology is just now at the cusp of utilizing them (                   In the original industrial context, digital twins have involved use of mathematical and computational models to virtually represent a physical object, predict its behavior, and facilitate decision-making to improve that behavior in the future (                   The idea of creating and using digital twins to encapsulate patient dynamics and to individualize the care of patients has grown in popularity.\nMore specifically for oncology, this is related to improvements in experimental techniques for quantitatively characterizing cancer as well as improvements in the mathematical and computational sciences (                   These have created significant interest in developing and utilizing image-guided digital twins for clinical oncology (          Medical imaging data from procedures such as x-ray CT, MRI and PET, can provide longitudinal in vivo measurements of cancers of individuals, and can be used to inform modeling at"

        "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Type 2 diabetes reversal has been viewed in the literature primarily as a dichotomous event (reversed or not reversed), even though this viewpoint may not be optimal for clinicians or patients.\nThis cohort study's objectives were to define stages of type 2 diabetes reversal and measure changes in reversal stages before and after 90 days of digital twin-enabled precision nutrition therapy.\nMethods: This study defines seven stages of diabetes reversal.\nThe study is a retrospective pre/post comparison of changes in reversal stage, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, body mass index (BMI), and other metrics measured before and after precision nutrition therapy.\nReversal stages were defined as Stage 0: HbA1c < 5.7% without medication subgroup.\nConclusions: Type 2 diabetes patients reached diefring reversal stages during 90 days of precision nutrition therapy.\nUse of reversal stages may benefit patients during therapy.\nTrial registration: This was a retrospective study that was approved by the Medisys Clinisearch Ethical Review Board (without registration number) in 2019."

        "Abstract": " - Nmore important in our daily lives.\nAccording onwoven products have become more and to EDANA, the European trade association for the nonwovens industry, the annual average growth rate of nonwoven production in the last decade was 4%.\nIn 2020, the nonwoven production growth in Greater nonwovens (see EDANA1).\nOne obvious reason for the significant increase in production in 2020 is the increased demand for medical products, such as medical masks (FFP2, FFP3) or medical protective clothing.\nSpunbond processes are used to produce outer layers of nonwovens, such as medical masks, which consist of several layers.\nIn a spunbond process, a polymer is extruded to thousands of very thin fibers that are twirled by air and stochastically laid down to a conveyor belt.\nFinally, the nonwoven fabric is calendered, pleated, and seamed (see Albrecht et al.\u2019s work2 for details of the manufacturing process).\nControlling the spunbond production process is a big challenge for the industry due to its stochastic nature.\nTypically, the manufacturing takes place 24/7, which limits longer experimental series.\nHence, usually a digital twin is used to analyze nonwoven production processes for digital quality inspection (see Figure 1).\nUsing a digital twin has the advantage that the influence of varying process parameters on the product quality can be systematically analyzed in an ideal machine.\nThe digital twin for spunbond processes is split into two parts according to the twirling of the fibers in the air and to the stochastic fiber laydown.\nHere, we focus on the superposition of the fibers on the belt forming the nonwoven fabric.\nDue to the stochastic nature of the fiber laydown, this part of the digital twin is based on a stochastic surrogate model.\ntwin (blue) allows for digital inspection of real processes (green).\nThe machine learning (ML) twin (orange) reduces computational costs for quality prediction that enable parameter space exploration (pink) and the finding of optimized parameter settings for the physical process (green).\nWe abbreviate this model and the software as SURRO."
